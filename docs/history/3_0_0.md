# dj-stripe 3.0.0 (20XX-XX-XX)

!!! attention

    3.0.0 is a significantly backwards-incompatible release. Migrating a 2.x database is
    unsupported due to significant changes to the data models.

## Release highlights


## Breaking changes

-   Migrations have been reset.
-   Removed deprecated `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_TOLERANCE` setting.
-   Removed legacy `Customer.add_card()` method. Use `Custoner.add_payment_method()` instead.
-   Most of the models visible in the Django Admin are now read-only. (Note: This does
    not change anything functionally, as editing models was not replicated upstream.)
